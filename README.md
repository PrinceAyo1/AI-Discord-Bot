# OpenAI Chatbot in Discord

## Description

This was a project set for us at Founders and Coders which required us to set up a Discord Bot with Open AI as backend. The task progressed to testing and DevOps (deploying the bot to Github and AWS EC3 using terraform).
While I was working on understanding testing, using Jest and Node's inbuilt testing framework, the work progressed, so I had to deploy this to my Github account for my personal development.

I acknowledge the work of @bajii2020 who supplied the original code and @nascho who worked extensively on it to bring it to life.
